# Welcome to Mug-n-AI! ☕🤖

Mug-n-AI is inspired by my two trusty companions: a warm mug of something delicious and artificial intelligence. The name reflects the heart of the creations you’ll find in these repositories: simple, warm, and focused. Here, you’ll discover a collection of my public projects, lovingly crafted during my free time.

It’s all about finding joy in creating and sharing, one mug at a time.

## What's in the mug? 🛠️

These projects are:

- Developed with a sprinkle of passion and curiosity 🌟
- Powered by countless cups of coffee, tea, or hot chocolate 🍵
- Open-source and available for everyone to explore, contribute to, or simply enjoy 🚀

## Supporting the Journey 🚶‍♂️✨
